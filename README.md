# MyRoboticDog

hiiiiiii

This is my attempt of making a robot dog or quadroped, it uses the arduino libary Fabrik2D for a poor attempt of making inverse kinematics were i used a example from the libary to get the inverse kinematics of the leg. At first i tried to code it by hand but i since i could barley fiugre out how to do it on paper considering i havent learning anything like that in school even the pythagorem therom, i gave up and used the libarary. I made this mostly beacuse i have alaways loved the idea of having a robot that can walk, and i learned that i should also get stronger servos next time wich would help a lot.
